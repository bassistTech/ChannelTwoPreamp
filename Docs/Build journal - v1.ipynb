    "I've taken notes on my first build if Channel Two preamp, version 1. This is a brand new design for me, meaning it's the first time I've ever seen the circuit board for real, and there might be mistakes in the board. It's easier to troubleshoot a partially populated board, because if there are problems, they're confined to the parts that are already on the board, and there's less stuff to get in the way of my soldering iron.\n",

    "**Signal generator**. Mine's homemade, and just generates a dirty variable sinewave. It's not very good, but works well enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Oscilloscope**. Two channels are enough. I usually like to see the input signal on one channel, and use the other channel for actually testing things.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audio response testing**. Because I'm the first person to build this thing, I want to see that it actually behaves as designed. I have a cheap USB audio adapter, and frequency response testing software, that I use for checking out all of my builds."

You can buy jacks with a metal bushing that are inherently grounded too.\n",
